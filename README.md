# Appointment Scheduler
Chat Bot to schedule a Doctor Appointment using Microsoft Bot Framework and LUIS

1.When the user starts conversation, he/she is prompted to say their name

To schedule successfully, the following two steps are required.

2.User can enter the name of the doctor or choose from a given list of options.
3.User has to specify the time of appointment.

I used Glitch to author the node js application and test it. That is the reason you will see a commit from glitch.
